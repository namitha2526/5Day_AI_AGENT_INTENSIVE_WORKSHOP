Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📖 Get started with Kaggle Notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using Kaggle Notebooks, welcome!

Its instruction prompt gets long and confusing. It's hard to debug (which part failed?), difficult to maintain, and often produces unreliable results.\n\n**The Solution: A Team of Specialists**\n\nInstead of one \"do-it-all\" agent, we can build a **multi-agent system**. This is a team of simple, specialized agents that collaborate, just like a real-world team. Each agent has one clear job (e.g., one agent *only* does research, another *only* writes). This makes them easier to build, easier to test, and much more powerful and reliable when working together.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [LLM agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/llm-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Single Agent vs Multi-Agent Team**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph Single[\"❌ Monolithic Agent\"]\n        A[\"One Agent Does Everything\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Multi[\"✅ Multi-Agent Team\"]\n        B[\"Root Coordinator\"] -- > C[\"Research Specialist\"]\n        B -- > E[\"Summary Specialist\"]\n\n        C -- >|findings| F[\"Shared State\"]\n        E -- >|summary| F\n    end\n\n    style A fill:#ffcccc\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style F fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"800\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/multi-agent-team.png\" alt=\"Multi-agent Team\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.1 Example: Research & Summarization System\n\nLet's build a system with two specialized agents:\n\n1. **Research Agent** - Searches for information using Google Search\n2. **Summarizer Agent** - Creates concise summaries from research findings","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Research Agent: Its job is to use the google_search tool and present findings.\nresearch_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"ResearchAgent\",\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n    instruction=\"\"\"You are a specialized research agent.

It's time to discover Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), a game-changer for modern software development. Forget one massive program; MAS is like building a team of specialized digital experts, each with its own goals and skills, all working in concert to achieve a grander objective.\n\nWhat makes MAS so powerful? It's the essence of **decentralized intelligence**. Complexity is shattered, with each agent handling its piece of the puzzle. These agents are **autonomous**, making their own decisions and acting proactively. Crucially, they can **communicate and collaborate**, tackling challenges far beyond the reach of a single entity.\n\nFor developers, this translates into a dramatically better workflow. MAS promotes **modularity**, meaning each agent is a self-contained unit. This makes development, testing, and maintenance a dream, banishing the horrors of tangled monolithic codebases. Need to scale? Just add more agents! This **enhanced scalability and flexibility** is a huge win. Plus, with distributed intelligence, your system gains incredible **fault tolerance** – if one agent stumbles, others can adapt.\n\nBeyond your workflow, MAS unlocks advanced capabilities in your software: truly **complex problem-solving**, **adaptive and learning systems** that evolve over time, and **autonomous decision-making** in dynamic environments.\n\nThe future of software is collaborative. Embrace the paradigm shift of Multi-Agent Systems and start building your smarter, more resilient digital workforce today!\nEditorAgent > ## Multi-Agent Systems: Your New Superpower for Smarter Software Development\n\nAre you tired of monolithic codebases that are a nightmare to maintain and scale?

A storm raged, not with wind and rain, but with a strange, ethereal light. It pulsed from the rocky cove below, drawing his gaze. Grabbing his oil lamp, Elias descended. Nestled amongst the seaweed was a rolled parchment, intricately detailed, and glowing with an otherworldly luminescence. The markings weren't of any coast he knew. Strange symbols pulsed on the map, each one a tiny beacon. He unfurled it fully, the light bathing his weathered face in an alien glow.

How does the \"alien glow\" feel against his skin?\n*   **Show, Don't Tell:** The ending states, \"A new journey, it seemed, was about to begin.\" Consider showing this rather than telling. Perhaps Elias looks out at the sea with a newfound purpose, or a specific symbol on the map triggers a memory or a decisive action.\nRefinerAgent > Elias polished the lantern, the rhythmic squeak of the cloth a familiar lullaby that had underscored his solitary existence for thirty years.

A storm unlike any he had ever witnessed raged, not with the usual fury of wind and rain, but with a strange, ethereal light that pulsed from the rocky cove below, an unholy beacon that snagged his attention.\n\nA tremor, not of fear but of an unsettling anticipation, ran through him. Clutching his oil lamp, Elias descended the treacherous path, the salt spray cold against his weathered skin. Amongst the tangled, glistening seaweed, he found it—a rolled parchment, intricately detailed and emitting an otherworldly luminescence that defied the gloom. As his fingers brushed against it, a faint warmth spread, and the parchment felt unnaturally smooth, like polished bone. He unrolled it, the strange symbols on its surface pulsing like tiny, captive stars. These were no coastlines he recognized; the markings were alien, the symbols vibrating with a silent energy that seemed to hum against his fingertips.\n\nOne symbol, a swirling vortex of light, snagged his gaze. It pulsed brighter, resonating with a forgotten ache deep within him, a whisper of a past he couldn't quite grasp. The alien glow washed over his face, not cold, but strangely invigorating, chasing away the ingrained loneliness. He looked from the map to the churning sea, no longer just a keeper of the light, but a potential voyager. A deep breath, tasting of salt and ozone and the inexplicable magic of the parchment, filled his lungs. His hand clenched around the map, the weathered lines of his palm aligning with the glowing script. His gaze swept across the horizon, a new, resolute glint in his eyes.

Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n\nYou used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n### 📚 Learn More\n\nRefer to the following documentation to learn more:\n\n- [Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/)\n- [Sequential Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents/)\n- [Parallel Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents/)\n- [Loop Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/)\n- [Custom Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/custom-agents/)\n\n### 🎯 Next Steps\n\nReady for the next challenge?
