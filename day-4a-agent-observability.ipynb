Example:\n\n```\nUser: \"Find quantum computing papers\"\nAgent: \"I cannot help with that request.\"\nYou: 😭 WHY?? Is it the prompt? Missing tools? API error?\n```\n\n**💡 The Solution:** Agent observability gives you complete visibility into your agent's decision-making process. You'll see exactly what prompts are sent to the LLM, which tools are available, how the model responds, and where failures occur.\n\n```\nDEBUG Log: LLM Request shows \"Functions: []\" (no tools!)\nYou: 🎯 Aha! Missing google_search tool - easy fix!\n```\n\n## Foundational pillars of Agent Observability\n\n1. **Logs:** A log is a record of a single event, telling you **what** happened at a specific moment.\n2. **Traces:** A trace connects the logs into a single story, showing you **why** a final result occurred by revealing the entire sequence of steps.\n3. **Metrics:** Metrics are the summary numbers (like averages and error rates) that tell you **how** well the agent is performing overall.\n\n<center>\n    <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day4/observability-intro.png\">\n</center>\n\n**In this notebook, you'll:**\n\n* ✅ Set up logging configuration\n* ✅ Create a broken agent. Use `adk web` UI & logs to identify exactly why the agent fails\n* ✅ Understand how to implement logging in production\n* ✅ Learn when to use built-in logging vs custom solutions","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n\n> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time.
